# TypeScript & Netlify Functions

See the following blog post at <DEV.TO POST>

## Running Locally
Ensure you have [Netlify Dev installed globally](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#installation).

Then run `netlify dev` which will open a page with some links to some prebuilt Netlify funtions.

## Further Development

Extend or add your own netlify functions by creating a new `.ts` file in the `./functions` folder. Remember to run `npm run build` after change (sorry no fancy auto-reload).

Read the Netlify docs further information about [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/#format).
