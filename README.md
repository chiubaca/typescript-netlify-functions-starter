# TypeScript & Netlify Functions

This repo is related to this blog - https://dev.to/chiubaca/typescript-and-netlify-functions-37b8 👀

## Running Locally 💻
Ensure you have [Netlify Dev installed globally](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#installation).

Then run `netlify dev` which will open a page with some links to some prebuilt Netlify funtions.

## Further Development 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Extend or add your own netlify functions by creating a new `.ts` file in the `./functions` folder. Remember to run `npm run build` after change (sorry no fancy auto-reload).

Read the Netlify docs further information about [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/#format).
